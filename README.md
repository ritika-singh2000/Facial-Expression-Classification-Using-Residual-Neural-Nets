# Facial-Expression-Classification-Using-Residual-Neural-Nets ðŸ˜ƒ

In this project , deep learning model based on `Convoluted Neural Network (CNN)` and `Residual Blocks` is used to predict Facial Expressions (emotions)ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜”.

Facial Expression serves as the basis for Emotion AI like detecting customer responses to Ads and Driver Monitoring Systems.

Data Augumentation is also used to make a better generalization.ðŸŒŸ
